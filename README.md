## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My Process

Here are some key steps I undertook to realize this project:

- Created a project template with Vite
- Developed components and component structure
- Applied basic styles (sizing, positioning)
- Added placeholder headings/texts, icons, colors, background images
- Implemented functions for click behavior, expanding, contracting, etc.
- Added properties to components to define their state and bound specific styles to the state of components
- Bound the aforementioned functions to the respective elements
- Tested the component/application behavior
- Added keyboard navigation and a small rectangular `<div>` to inform about keyboard navigation
- Adjusted styles

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS Keyframes 
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - JavaScript library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Build tool

### What I Learned

I had a hard time getting the background image right (positioning, repeating, etc.). Responsiveness for mobile devices was also a challenge for me.
I've never used CSS Keyframes before. After some research, I became comfortable with them. 
I used Vue 3 with the Composition API for this project, which I am fairly new to. Getting some practice with this technology was a great learning experience.
