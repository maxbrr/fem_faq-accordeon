## My process

Here are some key steps I undertook to realize this project:

- Created project-template with vite
- Created components / component structure
- Applies basic styles ( sizing, positioning )
- Added placeholder headings/texts, icons, colors, background images
- Implemented functions for click behaviour, exapanding, contracting, etc.
- Added properties to components to define their state | Bound specific styles to state of components
- Bound the aforementioned functions to the respective elements
- Tested the component/Application behaviour
- Added keyboard navigation | added small rectangular <div> to inform about keyboard navigation
- Adjusted styles

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS Keyframes 
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Build tool

### What I learned

I had hard time getting the background image right ( positioning, repeating, etc. ). The respponsiveness for mobile devices has also been a challenge for me.
I've never used CSS-Keyframes before. After some research, i was comfortable using them. 
I used Vue 3 with the Composition API for this project, which I am fairly new to. Getting some practice with this technology was a great learning experience.
